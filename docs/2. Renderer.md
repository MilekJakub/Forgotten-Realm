# Renderer

To draw something on the screen using OpenGL we have to go through many steps.

In order to render a simple triangle we need to:

1. **Initialize OpenGL Context**: Before we start drawing, we need to initialize OpenGL and create a context to render in. This is done in `Game` class.

2. **Create Shader Program**: Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU. For a simple triangle, we'll need at least a vertex shader and a fragment shader. 

   a. **Vertex Shader**: This shader takes in vertex data and transforms it. At a minimum, it needs to output the final position of the vertices in clip coordinates.

   b. **Fragment Shader**: This shader decides the color of each pixel. For simplicity, we might start with a uniform color for the entire triangle.

3. **Compile and Link Shaders**: Write the shader source code, compile it at runtime, check for compilation errors, and link the shaders into a shader program that can be used by OpenGL.

4. **Set Up Vertex Data and Buffers**: Define the vertices of triangle, and create a VBO to store this vertex data in the GPU's memory.

5. **Configure Vertex Attributes**: OpenGL needs to know how to interpret the vertex data in the VBO. This is done by specifying vertex attribute pointers. For a simple triangle, we might only need one attribute: the vertex positions.

6. **Create a Vertex Array Object (VAO)**: A VAO stores all of the vertex attribute pointers. Binding a VAO saves time when drawing by avoiding the need to specify attribute pointers every time.

7. **Rendering Loop**:
   a. **Clear the Screen**: At the beginning of each render loop iteration, clear the screen to prepare for the new frame.
   b. **Use the Shader Program**: Activate the shader program with `glUseProgram`.
   c. **Bind the VAO**: Bind the VAO that contains your triangle's vertex attributes.
   d. **Draw the Triangle**: Finally, issue a draw call with `glDrawArrays` or `glDrawElements`.

8. **Cleanup**
